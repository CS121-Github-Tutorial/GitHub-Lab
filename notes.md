At the final step, after running the following commands:
```
  git add index.html
  git commit -m "Close #1"
  git push
```
The changes were reflected in the forked repository, but not
in the master protected repository. Likewise, the issue was
not updated in the project as done (although it was recognized
that this issue was open in the fork). The issue was only updated
in the project once we created and finished a pull request. This final
step could be added to make the instructions more clear.
